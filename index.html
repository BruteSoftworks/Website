            <h2>Who We Are</h2>

            <p>We're Brute Softworks, and we've been writing software in Phoenix, Arizona since 2019.
                We believe that in order to write quality software you need an organized process from the ground up. The best software, like bread, takes time and effort to knead into place. I started this company because for two reasons: One, I want to have a space to bring my passion projects to life. Two, I want to work for a shop that focuses on developing code the right way from the start. We're looking forward to the release of our Kopi Luwak Lead Generation package.
